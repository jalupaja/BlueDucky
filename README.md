## Introduction üì¢
BlueDucky is a powerful tool for exploiting a vulnerability in Bluetooth devices. By running this script, you can:

1. üì° Load saved Bluetooth devices that are no longer visible but have Bluetooth still enabled.
2. üìÇ Automatically save any devices you scan.
3. üíå Send messages via ducky script format to interact with devices.

I've successfully run this on a Raspberry Pi 4 using the default Bluetooth module. It works against various phones, with an interesting exception for a New Zealand brand, Vodafone.

## Installation and Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Setup Instructions for Debian-based 

```bash
# update apt
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# install dependencies from apt
sudo apt install -y bluez-tools bluez-hcidump libbluetooth-dev \
                    git gcc python3-pip python3-setuptools \
                    python3-pydbus

# install pybluez from source
git clone https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez.git
cd pybluez
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

### Setup Instructions for Arch-based

```bash
# update pacman & packages
sudo pacman -Syyu

# install dependencies
# since arch doesn't separate lib packages: libbluetooth-dev included in bluez package
sudo pacman -S bluez-tools bluez-utils bluez-libs bluez-deprecated-tools \
               python-setuptools python-pydbus
               git gcc python-pip \

# install pybluez from source
git clone https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez.git
cd pybluez
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

### Setup Instructions for NixOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jalupaja/BlueDucky.git
cd BlueDucky

nix-shell
```

## Running BlueDucky
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jalupaja/BlueDucky.git
cd BlueDucky
python3 BlueDucky.py
```

## Operational Steps üïπÔ∏è
1. On running, it prompts for the target MAC address.
2. Pressing nothing triggers an automatic scan for devices.
3. Devices previously found are stored in known_devices.txt.
4. If known_devices.txt exists, those devices will be available in the first prompt.
5. Executes using payload.txt file in DuckyScript format.
6. Successful execution will result in automatic connection and script running.

## DuckyScript üíª
üöß Work in Progress:
- Suggest me ideas

## Version 2.2 üêõ
- made by me, jalupa
- Code cleanup

## Version 2.1 üêõ
- Updated UI
- Improved User Experience
- Bluetooth Debugger; Checks your Bluetooth adapters, and installed dependencies before allowing access to the application, this is to prevent devices that are not supported.
- Please Note: Numerous Changes have been made,please reference the commit history for specific changes.

#### üìù Example payload.txt:
```bash
REM Title of the payload
STRING ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890!@#$%^&*()_-=+\|[{]};:'",<.>/?
GUI D
```

```bash
REM Opens a private browser to hackertyper.net
DELAY 200
ESCAPE
GUI d
ALT ESCAPE
GUI b
DELAY 700
REM PRIVATE_BROWSER is equal to CTRL + SHIFT + N
PRIVATE_BROWSER
DELAY 700
CTRL l
DELAY 300
STRING hackertyper.net
DELAY 300
ENTER
DELAY 300
```

## Enjoy experimenting with BlueDucky! üåü
